!Series_summary	"Individualized analysis through expression profiling of 20,000 probes in 28 tissue samples evaluated in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue obtained during surgical intervention in non-obese and obese patients. Patients consisted of men and women of varying body size (lean to severely obese). Samples were collected at the time of operation in the fasting state."																											
!Series_overall_design	Samples consisted of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue as well as a blood sample from lean and obese men and women removed in the fasting state at the time of surgery.																											
!Series_type	Expression profiling by array
